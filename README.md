# Ionic Framework with XcooBee Contactless Payment

This example uses the [XcooBee Payments SDK](https://github.com/XcooBee/payment-sdk-js) for JavaScript (Node JS & Browser).
Please clone to a directory on your system or copy example files from the SDK into separate directory.

This example project was build with Ionic [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) CLI. 
The SDK is plain ES6 JS and has no dependencies on the Ionic Framework so you can use it any browser based application or node js application. 

The SDK has support for both.

You will need to install the Ionic command line tools to run this example.


```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

## SDK

Information about SDK and its API is available in SDK Repo.

Please see [SDK](https://github.com/XcooBee/payment-sdk-js)


## Install

Use the `npm install` command in your terminal window after you have navigated to the project directory.

## Run

```
ionic serve
```


If your browser does not automatically open after you see `Files successfully emitted..` message in console try to manually go to the start page: 
`http://localhost:8100/home`
